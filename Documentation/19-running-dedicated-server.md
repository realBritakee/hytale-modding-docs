## Step 4: Server Authentication

### You MUST authenticate your server!

In order to allow players to connect to your dedicated server, you must authenticate it with Hytale. This is done by running the `auth login device` command in the server terminal.

Once authenticated, you can run the `auth persistence Encrypted` command to keep your server authenticated after restarting it.

**Never share your encrypted auth file!**
