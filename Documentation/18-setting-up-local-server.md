## Step 3: Server Authentication

### You MUST authenticate your server!

In order to connect to your local server, you must authenticate it with Hytale. This is done by running the `auth login device` command in the server terminal. This command will print a URL that you can use to authenticate the server using your Hytale account.

Once authenticated, you can run the `auth persistence Encrypted` command to keep your server authenticated after restarting it.

**Never share your encrypted auth file!**
