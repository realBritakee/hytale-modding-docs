## Key Takeaways

* **Asset Editor Access:** To use the editor, you must first op yourself in a creative world by typing `/op self` in the chat.
* **Pack Creation:** Packs can be created directly within the Asset Editor by clicking the three dots in the corner and selecting "Add Pack".
* **Folder Setup:** After creating a pack in-game, you must manually create a `Common/Resources` folder structure in the pack's directory to hold your texture files.
* **Custom Items:** You can quickly create new items by using the "Copy Asset" feature to duplicate an existing Hytale item and then modifying its texture and properties.
* **Localization:** To fix the item's name in the inventory, you need to create a `Server/Languages/en-US/server.lang` file and define the item name key.
* **Sharing Mods:** To make your mod available globally, compress the manifest and folders into a `.zip` file and move it to `%AppData%/Hytale/UserData/Mods/`.
