## What are Mods in Hytale?

Hytale mods are split into **three categories**:

### 1. Packs

**Packs** are asset/content packs that allow you to implement:
- New blocks
- New mobs
- New items
- Other custom behavior

**Key Features:**
- Can be modified using the **Asset Editor**
- **No coding experience required** for most settings
- Can be used in conjunction with Plugins

### 2. Plugins

**Plugins** are mods written in **Java** that:
- Use the game's API to expand vanilla functionality
- Add new content programmatically
- Require coding knowledge

### 3. Bootstrap/Early Plugins

**Bootstrap/Early Plugins** operate outside of the standard plugin environment:
- Perform **low-level modifications**
- Execute **class transformations** (altering/injecting bytecode into classes as they load)
- **Should only be used when absolutely necessary**

## Creation Tools

Hytale provides powerful built-in **Creation Tools** that make modding accessible:

### Available Tools:
- **Machinima** - For recording content
- **World Tools** - For expansive world modification and editing
- **Asset Editor** - For easily modifying Packs, adding new behavior and mechanics without coding

### Asset Editor
The **Asset Editor** is particularly important as it allows you to:
- Modify Pack settings visually
- Add new behavior to the game
- Create mechanics without writing code
- Edit all properties of blocks, items, and more
